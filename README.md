# CS163

Coursework and programs for CS163.

This repo serves multiple purposes: version control and backups for convenience,
as well as provide for myself a full accounting of my work such that I can revise,
review, and critique it at a later time. This repo is not to be used as a source of
plagarism for other students in their studies.
